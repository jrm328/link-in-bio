### Why This Deck Works
This list combines **Mortar**’s chip pressure with **X-Bow**’s win condition potential. If your opponent overspends on defending one, you punish with the other. The synergy is all about lane control and constant pressure.

### Full Deck List
- **X-Bow**  
- **Mortar**  
- **Knight**  
- **Archers**  
- **Baby Dragon**  
- **Skeleton Army**  
- **Bats**  
- **Snowball**

### Match Strategy
- **Single Elixir**: Use Mortar at the bridge for chip and cycle. Force them to commit cards.  
- **Double Elixir**: Defend until you find an opening to drop X-Bow opposite lane.  
- **Defense**: Knight + Archers handle tanks, while Skarmy and Bats provide emergency stalls.  
- **Spells**: Snowball buys time vs swarms and resets charging troops.
