Supercellâ€™s August balance changes are live, and the ladder meta is already shifting. Here are the biggest highlights:

### Key Buffs
- **X-Bow**: Deploy time reduced from 4.5s â†’ 4.0s. That tiny half-second makes X-Bow punish faster in single elixir.
- **Archers**: Hit speed increased 5%. They now cycle more shots per second, helping them shred swarms more efficiently.

### Key Nerfs
- **Baby Dragon**: Splash radius decreased 10%. It still clears swarms, but Skeleton Army and Bats can slip through if you mistime support spells.
- **Miner**: Crown Tower damage reduced 6%. Chip decks will feel this the most.

### Early Ladder Reactions
Players report that **Double Siege (X-Bow + Mortar)** feels stronger than it has in months. With Archers cycling faster and Baby Dragon less oppressive, control-style decks have breathing room.

Weâ€™ll keep an eye on CRL scrims over the next week to see if pros pick it up. For now, expect more X-Bow placements at the bridge in your ladder matches.
