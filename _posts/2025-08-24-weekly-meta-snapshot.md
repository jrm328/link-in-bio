Welcome to this week’s **Meta Snapshot** — a quick breakdown of the Clash Royale ladder and tournament environment, based on top 200 ladder replays, community tourneys, and early CRL scrims.

---

### 🔥 Tier List Overview
- **S-Tier**
  - **Double Siege (X-Bow + Mortar)** — benefiting from X-Bow deploy speed buff and Archers buff. Constant pressure wins games.
  - **Phoenix Miner Poison** — even after Miner’s tower damage nerf, Poison synergy keeps this deck strong in control matchups.

- **A-Tier**
  - **Royal Giant Lightning** — still a ladder staple; struggles vs. Double Siege if misplayed.
  - **Golem Beatdown** — punishes players who overcycle Mortar. Still fragile vs. fast cycle decks.
  - **Lava Loon Miner** — consistent in mid-ladder; high skill cap at top levels.

- **B-Tier**
  - **Log Bait** — viable but weaker with Snowball tech rising.
  - **Hog EQ Cycle** — effective, but struggles vs. decks with multiple cheap swarms (Bats, Skarmy).
  - **Bridge Spam (Bandit, Battle Ram, Magic Archer)** — good pressure, but feels risky vs. Skarmy-heavy decks.

---

### 📈 Trending Up
- **Mortar Variants** — players are rediscovering Mortar as a cheap win condition. Its synergy with Archers and Snowball gives it answers to nearly everything.
- **Skeleton Army** — the Baby Dragon nerf means swarms survive longer. Skarmy is punishing overcommits.
- **Poison over Fireball** — Poison’s zone control is stronger against Archers and swarms in the current patch.

---

### 📉 Trending Down
- **Miner Chip Decks** — Miner nerf hurt chip win conditions on Crown Towers.  
- **Baby Dragon** — splash radius nerf makes it less reliable as the universal answer.  
- **Electro Giant** — without buffs, it feels clunky against rising Siege strategies.

### 💡 Pro Takeaways
- Expect **siege decks** to rise in mid-ladder over the next 2 weeks.  
- **Archers are quietly MVP**: buff makes them cycle smoother and appear in multiple archetypes.  
- If you’re struggling with Miner Poison, tech in **Snowball** or **Tornado** for swarms.
