### Overview
This Double Siege deck thrives by alternating pressure between **Mortar** and **X-Bow**. Few opponents are comfortable defending two siege structures, making it a ladder menace when played correctly.

### Gameplan
1. **Early Game** — Open with Mortar at the bridge to test defenses. Don’t overcommit; keep Knight or Archers for defense.  
2. **Mid Game** — Cycle quickly to keep constant pressure. Bats and Snowball are your cheap answers to swarms.  
3. **Late Game** — Defend patiently, then punish with opposite-lane X-Bow once you’re up 2–3 elixir.

### Strengths
- Constant chip damage even if X-Bow doesn’t connect.  
- Solid cycle with plenty of cheap cards.  
- Split-lane control throws off heavy beatdown decks.

### Weaknesses
- Weak against fast cycle Fireball decks (they always hit Archers + Mortar).  
- Can struggle if opponent has both **Rocket** and **Valkyrie**.  
- Requires strong elixir management.

### Matchups
- **Vs. Golem/Beatdown**: Pressure opposite lane with Mortar. Defend with Knight + Archers, then sneak an X-Bow.  
- **Vs. Log Bait**: Snowball + Baby Dragon clears swarms. X-Bow can lock on if you bait Log with Skarmy.  
- **Vs. Hog Cycle**: Mortar for defense, X-Bow opposite lane when they overspend.
